# CS-201-Computational-Physics
This repository contains different projects given as a part of "Introductory Computational Physics" course at DA-IICT <br>
The course and assignments focus on simulating different physical systems in both ideal and real world conditions using MATLAB <br>
Also a thorough report is added in repository so that anyone can read and understand the physics and mathematics behind it and also various graphs are included to depict the state of system at various instants of time
